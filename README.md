# Who2whom


This project aims to develop a pipeline for making data-driven network modeling of agents and addresses and mapping their language. \
This project is carried out by Haleli Harel and Dina Serova, collaborating with the CRC project “Register knowledge in Ancient Egypt” (B03), 
carried out in the Department of “Archaeology and Cultural History of Northeast Africa” (AKNOA) at Humboldt-Universität, Berlin.

Who2whom was first presented in ASOR 2024, Boston. 
The talk's slides are available when clicking the image below:

Who2whom aims to add situational and functional tagging to language data. \
The variables we tagged in our pilot study are the following:

<H1> Tagging scheme: An agent-based situational model of language use </H1>

The basic annotations we added to the data allow us to structure a network of interconnections between agents in narrative text. \
For a case study, we used data digitized by the TLA project and added the following annotations per token (=word) in the text:  

<b>Agent:</b> Entity name, standardized in English. 

<b>Addressee:</b> Entity name, standardized in English. 

<b>Morphology gloss:</b> simplified tagging of morphological form to allow broader clustering. 

<b>Syntax gloss:</b> the exact gloss of the patterns, including number and complement gloss. 

<b>Setting:</b> The variable “Setting” parameters are following a CRC 1412 "Register" forthcoming publication: 

<b>Narration vs. representation of speech</b>
If representation of speech: oral or written?
Oral protagonists are represented as speaking orally to each other, 
e.g. face-to-face communication
Written protagonists are represented as communicating by use of the written medium with each other; 
protagonist A sends a letter to protagonist B with the utterance X

If representation of speech: direct or indirect?

<b>Direct quoted speech: </b>
The statement is introduced by the inquit-formula and is often (to be) rendered within quotation marks 
in modern language contexts (this applies especially to written sources). 

Direct speech is the “classical” device to represent speech in narrative texts and goes along with mediacy. 
The impression of an “unfiltered” statement by a third party is generated.
Ex. “Horus said to me: ‘I want  to be seated on the throne of my father Osiris!’”

<b>Embedded direct speech:</b>
Ex. “Horus said to Isis: ‘Seth said to me “You behave like a little boy”!’”
Agent: Horus: Seth
Addressee: Horus: Isis
Indirect reported speech:
The statement is introduced by the inquit-formula, 
but is not rendered within quotation marks in written media. 
Co-occurring changes within the reproduced statement include transpositions of 
the personal pronouns to the 2nd/3rd persons, of demonstratives as well as spatial 
and temporal deictica, changes in mood, etc.
Ex. “Horus said to me that he wanted to be seated on the throne of his father Osiris.”

<b>Number of interlocutors: </b>
1/2/3/many → 1/2/3/many 
1 → 1			one person speaks to one person
1 → 2			one person speaks to two people
1 → many		one person speaks to a group of people
2 → many		two people speak to a group of people
many → 1		a group of people (as if unisono) speaks to one person
many → 2		a group of people speaks to two people
many → many	a group of people speaks to a group of people; also a group of 
people talking to themselves  (autoreflexive)

<b>Specifics of the situation: </b>
<b>Audience</b>
+/-audience: presence vs. absence of spectators or an audience (questions: how private is a communication?)

<b>ratified</b>
+/-ratified: is the audience if present acknowledged and accepted by the interlocutors?; 
ratified audience (approved auditors) vs. non-ratified audience (overhearer; unknown spectators: eavesdroppers) 

<b>known</b>
+/-known: is the present audience known or unknown to the interlocutors? 
e.g., non-ratified and not known: eavesdroppers

<H1> Preliminary results: Dynamics of communication of Egyptian gods (directives in the Contendings of Horus and Seth) </H1>

More graphs, the annotated data, and the processing script notebook will appear here soon. \
